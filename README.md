# Function Vectorization

This repository consists of the following four folders:

- **Sum**: it contains three versions of the scalar sum function vectorization;
- **Stencil**: it contains the files of the *cpu* folder of the *stencil* benchmark in the Parboil benchsuite. The *kernel.c* file and the Makefile were the only modified files;
- **MRI-Q**: it contains the files of the *cpu* folder of the *MRI-Q* benchmark in the Parboil benchsuite. The *computeQ.cc* file and the Makefile were the only modified files;
- **Other_Tests**: it contains all the other benchmarks in the Parboil benchsuite that we tested for function vectorization.
